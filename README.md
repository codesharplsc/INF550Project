##Note
This program is the course project of INF550(Overview of Data informatics in large data environment). Using python, together with `Pandas` tool and `Scikit-learn` library, I do the classification and prediction on a dataset from UCI data respository.http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/. The dataset contains thousands of records and about a players' behavior in game. My focus is to find the key point that determines the skill levels of players.
